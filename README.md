# MakeThemFallTheGame
This is a simple game made with Processing and JBox2D. This my first big project. While reading the book Nature of code I thought of making something my own. So I made this. It game me a lot of experience. First time I faced the challenges of software development. Like planning, maintaining code etc. That time I didn't have git. Now I am learning about git and putting this here to test git.
Apology for my bad english.
